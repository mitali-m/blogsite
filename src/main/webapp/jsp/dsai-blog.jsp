                Talking robots are a thing of the past. Today, we want self-learning robots who can both 
                be our calculator and our friend. The course Data Science and Artificial Intelligence showed 
                us how to take the first baby step into the new and upcoming field. So my batch was the first 
                to experience this course and it was one of a kind!
              </p>
              <p>
                The beginnings of this course were confusing and hazy where I felt like I was being blindly 
                led through a dark tunnel. At one point I was collecting and cleaning data and at the next 
                I was interpreting a regression graph, I wasn't able to connect the dots until a very 
                informative meeting with the professor taking the subject. He showed me YouTube videos 
                on the advancements of AI to give me a bigger picture and then narrowed it down to show me 
                where I stand in that picture. He explained the intention behind each topic taught and how 
                they would eventually connect together to form a part of the big picture. That 45-minute 
                long meeting helped me piece together the concepts very clearly and intuitively.
              </p>
              <p>
                The course was conducted completely in Python, something I had experience with from the 
                previous semester. So I was able to manage the coding part after some practice as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was another very large "mini-project" in this course as well(just like in 
                <a href = "/bpr?p=ict-blog">ICT</a>). 
                Only this time, we had to do more than just recommend canteens, we had to do something 
                that could really be used in reality. The problem? We didn't have a problem statement. 
                The professor handed us a website link and 3 datasets to choose from, and asked us to 
                make our own question. Also the groups were also randomly allocated to us, which meant 
                that I would have to work with people who I had never seen before and could potentially 
                be unhelpful freeloaders.
              </p>
              <p>
                But as luck shines in unexpected places, I was placed in the best team I could ever hope for. 
                My group members were the most proactive and hard-working people I had ever seen in university, 
                and it was a pleasure working with them. It's only no wonder we ended up taking all future 
                classes together so that we could team up for projects again.
              </p>
              <p>
                Back to the "large" mini project. The first few weeks of the allocated time of the project 
                went in deciding the question and reviewing it with the professor. After that, we then 
                started on the coding. We decided to do a happiness index prediction model and analyse 
                with interactive graphs. After a lot of hard work, we were able to make the model and get 
                average prediction results as well. Presenting the project was also a good experience for 
                me(I have public speaking fright) but since I was clear on our work and the concepts we 
                used, I was able to present without a hitch.

              	This course was the major factor why I decided to do my URECA project in year 2 on deep learning. 
              	DSAI was a course that opened to me the doors to a whole new world and I'm beyond excited to see 
              	what lies in store for me there!
