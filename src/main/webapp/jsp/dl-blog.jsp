                Digital Logic was another instance of something I had almost never seen before. It was an introduction 
                to digital circuit design and my first ever exposure to hardware as a subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                This one started out simple and taught things like gate level design and truth tables; later, it delved 
                into synchronous circuit elements and Verilog programming; which is where the tension came in. As I 
                mentioned before, I had never seen anything related to hardware before this course. So when they started 
                introducing details on synchronous circuits and flip flops I began to worry as I was unable to cope with 
                the pace. I then decided to do some reading from the text book and solve some questions from there as well, 
                to supplement the material from the lectures. I also put in extra effort to solve the tutorials again, to try 
                and pick up something I may have missed. All these efforts eventually led to an improvement in my understanding 
                of the concepts taught.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was one of the more challenging courses 
                of the first semester, and the fact that I had no previous experience with it, worried me more. However 
                as the course progressed, I was able to grasp the concepts and developed an interest in them which further 
                helped me crystallize my understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another skill I was able to pick up through this course was Verilog programming because it closely resembles 
                C programming. Verilog programming later proved to be quite useful in year 2 as there was a follow-up 
                course for Digital Logic called Digital System Design which mainly dealt with more complex Verilog coding.
              </p>
              <p>
                I add a special mention to the professors who taught this course as their teaching was the 
                reason I was able to gain more knowledge on hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main lesson I learnt from this course was to keep looking for answers even when you don't 
                know what questions to ask. Being unable to understand anything during a portion of the course, I 
                found myself feeling quite lost and flustered, especially during the lab quizzes. But I kept trying to 
                read and gather information from lecture notes and tutorials and eventually managed to figure some of 
                the things out.
