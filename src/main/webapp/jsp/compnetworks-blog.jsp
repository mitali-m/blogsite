              	The content of computer networks was primarily focused on internet connections wirelessly and 
              	using ethernet, it also dealt with local network connections and subnets as well as how to 
              	interpret IP addresses.
              </p>
              <p>
              	The module was assessed through lab assignments and quizzes in place of the final exam since 
              	it was still COVID season. The lab assignments were quite heavy and needed a lot of time to complete. 
              	The tutorials were helpful to get an idea of how the quiz questions would be like and also to further 
              	understand the material.
              </p>
              <p>
              	I found the IP addresses topic a little difficult because there were many things to keep in mind while solving those problems and 
              	it took a little practice to get a good control of it. Solving past papers and tutorials repeatedly helped with that.
              </p>
              <p>
              	I also developed the habit of going through past papers in advance through this module since 
              	I did not feel that the tutorials were enough practice for me. Cultivating this habit of practicing 
              	using the past year papers well in advance helped a lot with future modules in final year where 
              	there were final exams I needed to prepare for.
              </p>
              <p>
              	The lab assignments were heavy weightage tasks with many sub questions to be solved and 
              	submitted by the respective deadlines. They were time intensive and needed a lot of referring and reading from the internet.
              </p>
              <p>
              	Although this module was slightly challenging, I was able to achieve a good grade of A-.
